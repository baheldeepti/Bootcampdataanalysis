ðŸ“š Measuring the True Impact of Coding Bootcamps: A Causal Inference Approach
ðŸ›  Project Overview
This project estimates the true causal effect of attending a coding bootcamp on annual salaries using causal inference techniques.

Rather than relying on naive correlations, we simulate a realistic observational dataset with confounders and apply Propensity Score Matching (PSM) to adjust for selection bias.

ðŸ“ˆ Problem Statement
While coding bootcamps advertise significant salary boosts, observational data often suffers from selection bias â€” individuals self-select into bootcamps based on characteristics like education and experience.

This project aims to answer:

"What is the true average impact of attending a coding bootcamp on salary, after adjusting for confounders?"

ðŸ”Ž Dataset
Synthetic dataset of 5,000 individuals with features:

age

prior_experience

education_level

region

treatment (bootcamp attended = 1 / not attended = 0)

salary

Confounders are intentionally embedded into treatment assignment.

ðŸ§  Methodology
Data Simulation: Realistic generation of observational data with biased treatment assignment

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Visualize selection bias across confounders

Naive Estimation: Initial salary difference without adjustment

Propensity Score Matching (PSM):

Estimate propensity scores using logistic regression

Match treated and untreated individuals based on nearest neighbor matching

Causal Effect Estimation: Calculate the true Average Treatment Effect on the Treated (ATT)

ðŸ“Š Key Results

Step	Result
Naive Salary Difference	+$13,757
True Causal Effect (ATT after PSM)	+$10,003
ðŸ“š Conclusion
Coding bootcamps do causally increase salaries by approximately $10,000, after adjusting for confounding factors.

This project highlights the necessity of causal inference in understanding real-world effects and avoiding misleading conclusions based on raw correlations.

ðŸš€ Future Work
Apply Difference-in-Differences (DiD) if pre/post bootcamp salary data becomes available

Use Causal Forests to identify heterogeneous treatment effects (who benefits the most)

Incorporate additional covariates (technical skills, certifications, portfolio strength)
